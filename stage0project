<h1> Background </h1>

<b> How the Internet Works </b>
<p> When you type an address on you browser like <a href = "www.google.com"> google </a> 
your computer sends a request to a server (a computer that stores the content
you're looking for) using a language or protocol named HTTP. HTTP is sort of
an instruction for the server, which uses that instruction to give you the 
information you want. Then the server gives you the information, and finally 
your browser translates that information into content you can see on your screen. 
All the content we see on the internet is largely made up of HTML documents. 
HMTL stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is the language browsers use to 
interpret web pages. The content of the web includes the client 
(your computer and the browser), the internet, and servers.
The client and the servers interact through something called the Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
</p>

<b> HTML Markup and Tags </b>
<p> The HTML Markup is how the content looks like. To provide an specific look to
the content the browser displays we use <em> tags </em>. In other words, tags
are what we use to tell the browser how to display content in a web page. Most
HTML tags consist of an opening tag and a closing tag.
</p>

<b> HMTL Attributes </b>
<p> Some tags accept additional values called attributes. They provide additional
information to the browser. One tag can cause different effects depending on the
value of the tag attribute it has.
</p>

<b> Inline and Block </b>
<p> HTML elements can either be <em> inline <em> or <block>. Block elements
  create a block around the content inside of them, so need to necessarly write
  an opening tag and a closing tag. Inline elements affect the content which is
  in the same line the tag is written.
