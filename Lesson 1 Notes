<h1> Background </h1>

<b> How the Internet Works </b>
<p> When you type an address on you browser, your computer sends a request
to a server (a computer that stores the content you're looking for) using a
language or protocol named HTTP. HTTP is sort of an instruction for the server,
which uses that instruction to give you the information you want. Then the server
gives you the information, and finally your browser translates that information
into content you can see on your screen. All the content we see on the internet
is largely made up of HTML documents. HMTL stands for Hypertext Markup Language
and is the language browsers use to interpret web pages. The content of the web
includes the client (your computer and the browser), the internet, and servers.
The client and the servers interact through something called the Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

<b> HTML Markup and Tags </b>
<p> The HTML Markup is how the content looks like. To provide an specific look to
the content the browser displays we use <em> tags </em>. In other words, tags
are what we use to tell the browser how to display content in a web page. Most
HTML tags consist of an opening tag and a closing tag.
</p>

<b> HMTL Attributes </b>
<p> Some tags accept additional values called attributes. They provide additional
information to the browser. One tag can cause different effects depending on the
value of the tag attribute it has.
